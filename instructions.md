### Overview

In order to get started you should start by forking the repository. 
 
### Milestones

The tasks for the techinical interview are broken down into three milestones: 

- [#1 - User Account Setup](/instructions.md#1---user-account-setup)
- [#2 - Drupal/WordPress Installation](/instructions.md#2---drupalwordpress-installation) 
- [#3 - Tests and verification](/instructions.md#3---tests-and-verification)

##### #1 - User Account Setup

Before you can access the virtual machine to start the project, a user account will need to be setup and a public key added. This can be done by using a public key that can be uploaded to you Pantheon Account.   

Once the Pantheon account has been created and the SSH public key, it will be uploaded to the server for the project and you will be given an I.P. address and login information.

##### #2 - Drupal/WordPress Installation

Once you have logged into the server, you will need to install a set of dependencies. 

- **Apache/Nginx**: In order to perform nginx access log analysis with goaccess locally the logger will require
    the program to be installed.
- **MySQL/MariaDB**: In order to use the Percona toolkit MySQL query digest without Docker or Vagrant
   will require the Percona Toolkit to be installed.alysis with goaccess locally the logger will require
    the program to be installed.
- **PHP/PHP-FPM**: In order to use the Percona toolkit MySQL query digest without Docker or Vagrant
   will require the Percona Toolkit to be installed.
- **Redis**: In order to use the Percona toolkit MySQL query digest without Docker or Vagrant
   will require the Percona Toolkit to be installed.
- **Varnish**: In order to use the Percona toolkit MySQL query digest without Docker or Vagrant
   will require the Percona Toolkit to be installed.

[Milestone #2 Issues >>](https://github.com/timani/technical-interview/milestones/Objective%203%20-%20Tests%20and%20verification) 

##### #3 - Tests and verification

There are a set of configuration and infrstrature tests that will be run to see the progress within the tasks. Ideally all the tests pass but this should not the focus as we are more interested in the process of working through the assigned issues.
